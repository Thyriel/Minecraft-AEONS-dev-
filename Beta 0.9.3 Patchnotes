Done:
- updated various mods
- new Roguelike Dungeon version allows using normal loottables > no more vanilla tools / weapons / ingots in dungeon chests
- added own loottable to dungeon chests
- changed ALL crafting quests to retrieval quests (bug with PrimalCore crafting table sometimes not updating crafting quests).
   This should fix all non working quest issues (hopefully)
  
Testing:
- new "Item stage" mod (restricting Armors to the proper material stage)

ToDo:
- add various potions to dungeon loot
- add enchanted armor to dungeon loot
- test loot distribution
